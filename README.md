This repository contains code for the JavaScript version of the [Microsoft Bot Builder SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder). The Bot Builder SDK v4 is the latest SDK for building bot applications. 

In addition to the JavaScript SDK, Bot Builder supports creating bots in other popular programming languages like [.NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet), [Python](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python), and [Java](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java).

To get started see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) for the v4 SDK.

A rich set of samples are available at [BotBuilder-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples) repository.
